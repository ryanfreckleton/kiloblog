KiloBlog
========
A simple blog engine written in 1024 bytes of minified, gzipped python code.

- https://github.com/ryanfreckleton/kiloblog

Designed primarily as a starting point for others to expand on and teaching tool.
Non-python code also needs to be 1024 bytes when minified.
Libraries through CDN or installable from PyPI don't count towards the limit.

Tests, configuration, build files, etc. don't count towards this limit.

So this means:

- Python [gzipped/minified] 1 kilobyte
- HTML [gzipped/minified] 1 kilobyte
- CSS [gzipped/minified] 1 kilobyte
- Javascript [gzipped/minified] 1 kilobyte

Total: 4 kilobytes
